            <li> For different cooking temps;</li>
            <li>  - Rare -> 130 degrees; soft feeling all over the steak when pressing down </li>
            <li>  - Medium Rare -> 140 degrees; firm around the edges with a soft center </li>
            <li>  - Medium Well -> 150 degrees; firm around with the center firming and the steak shrinking as the marbeling liqiuefies.</li>

            <li> Cook to desired temperature on each side </li>
            <li> Once the steak is flipped, put in the butter and the crushed garlic into the pan. </li>
            <li> Take a teaspoon and baste the steak with the butter and garlic as the opposing side is being cooked</li>
            <li> Once the desired temperature of the opposing side is reached, remove the steak from the pan and place it onto your dish, leave it to rest for 5-7 minutes</li>
